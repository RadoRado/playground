# Prolog & Logic Programming

```
- How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?
- Yes.
```

To run `*.pl` files, you need [**SWI Prolog**](http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/Debian.html)

The steps are:

1. Run the `swipl` command
2. If you have a file called `magic.pl`, you can load it with `?- consult(magic).` within `swipl`
3. Ask questions and get answers!
